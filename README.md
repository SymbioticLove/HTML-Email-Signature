<h1>Simple HTML Email Signature</h1>
This is a simple email signature made on a single HTML document. There are a few Javascript functions, as well as several links. You can check it out at https://symbioticlove.github.io/HTML-Email-Signature/!
<h2>Example 1 Desktop Version</h2>

<h2>Links</h2>
The links on my signature point to our store, our main Github profile, and to our main site. If you're in need of a signature, we can point links wherever you need.
<h2>Javascript Functions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Delay font loading until the DOM is loaded</li>
  <li>Change the color of the signature randomly when moused over</li>
  <li>Create a star trail from the mouse when moving</li>
</ol>
<div>&nbsp</div>
These are just a few of the functions that can be included. If you have an idea that you'd like to add to yours, we're happy to! Reach out to us at outreach@symbiotic.love!
